## Libraries
- pandas and numpy: for data manipulation
- matplotlib and seaborn: for data visualization
- scikit-learn: for machine learning
- wordcloud": for visual representation of text data
- chardet:  (Character Encoding Detector) is a Python library used to detect the encoding of text files or byte strings
- re and nltk: for text analysis
